This repository contains the development and evaluation of a Fall Detection Hexapod, designed to address fall management in an ageing population. The hexapod is powered by a Raspberry Pi and incorporates various features aimed at providing a proof-of-concept fall management solution.

## Abstract
This project focuses on the construction, implementation, and evaluation of a Fall Detection Hexapod. The primary objective was to develop a robot capable of detecting falls and assisting in fall prevention within social care settings. The hexapod utilizes a Raspberry Pi for processing and control and incorporates features such as a guiding night light, a camera with computer vision algorithms for person tracking, artificial intelligence for fall detection, Wi-Fi connectivity for emergency call functionality, and voice command recognition.

The aim of this project was not only to create a functional fall detection hexapod but also to explore the potential applications and practicality of accessible technologies, such as the Raspberry Pi, in developing customizable care solutions. The study emphasizes the practical implementation and assessment of the hexapod rather than expanding the field of robotics.

Discussions in this project include the performance of the fall detection hexapod, the effectiveness of the guiding night light, and the potential impact on addressing the challenges of falls in an ageing population. Future research directions, including user testing and cost analysis, are also highlighted to enhance the understanding and practicality of this technology.
